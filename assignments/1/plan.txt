3 files:

shell.cpp: reading/writing to terminal, command parsing
commands.cpp: implementations of the required commands
data.cpp: constants and data structures defined here

one .h defining everything? or could do one per cpp

going to do this without the function map, then see if it still makes sense at the end.

< and > should change cin and cout

each cmd implemented as a function that returns some output (usually std::string?)

I think the calling process should always create a new process for a command, but if & isn't called it should use wait to pause until it is done?
